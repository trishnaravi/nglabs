## Approaches to work on exercises
* Open readme in edit mode
* Click on split screen with magnifying glass while in this mode
* follow steps and when creating html etc, if tabs for open files in the same pane, drag to other pane to see side by side
* Give yourself more space or get back to menu:
    * Hide/Reveal the left menu by clicking the relevant icon
* If using dual monitors, use GitHub to view the README. If using a virtual machine - get familiar with how to copy and paste from host to virtual machine. (Guacamole uses Control-Alt-Shift to allow copy/paste)

## Stopping servers

* Trashcan kills process AND the window
