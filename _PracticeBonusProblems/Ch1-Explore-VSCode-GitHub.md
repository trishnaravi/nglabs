### ** Navigating the course on Github**

1. If you havent already, please provide a GitHub id to your instructor. This will allow you to login to and use a browser to navigate this course's labs via the Git repository Angular100-Labs (with the date specific to your class).  You can return to this section once you have been added to the repository - and use these steps to view the repo in the browser.

   Using GitHub is a helpful option if you are using a virtual machine for class and have more than one monitor. If this is your situation, you may want to open the GitHub link on the second monitor as you move forward in the directions.
