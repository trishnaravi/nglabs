# Chapter 5 Directives: ngFor

## Objectives

- Copy more data into the project and use ngFor to display all albums

## Steps

1. Continue working in your angular100-labs project in your branch. If you haven't completed previous exercises, you can copy the solution files from the last exercise.

1. In this folder's README there is a file called **albums.data.ts**. Open and examine this file and copy it to your project's app/albums folder. (src/app/albums)

1. Replace the content of **album.model.ts** with the following to add in the Album properties that were not present before, and to add in Track.

    ```typescript
    export interface Album {
      id: number;
      artist: string;
      albumName: string;
      genre: string;
      price: number;
      currency?: string;
      onSale: boolean;
      year: number;
      releaseDate: string;
      recordingLocation: string;
      duration: string;
      url: string;
      tracks: Track[];
    }

    export interface Track {
      id: number;
      trackNumber: number;
      title: string;
      length: string;
    }
    ```

1. Now, in **album-list.component.ts** - import this JSON file using an import.

   ```typescript
   import { ALBUMS } from "../albums.data";
   ```

1. Modify **album-list.component.ts** so that the ngOnInit() is simply:

   ```typescript
   ngOnInit(): void {
    this.albumsArray = ALBUMS;
   }
   ```

2. In **album-list.component.html**, modify the inclusion of the three cards, to be a single card reference that uses an \*ngFor:

   ```html
   <app-album-card
     *ngFor="let album of albumsArray"
     [album]="album"
     (albumClicked)="parentFunctionHandler($event)"
   ></app-album-card>
   ```

    Make sure to keep the above still contained in the following two <divs>

    ```html
    <div class="container-fluid">
      <div class="card-deck">
    ```

3. Now in the browser you should now see all of the albums. Now that we have more data - resize the browser to see the responsiveness from using Bootstrap. Can you point out what part of your code is has Bootstrap implement this functionality?

4. Once this is working, mark your work as complete.

## Bonus

Create a new from scratch application that displays a person, as well as their family and friends. Hold onto an array of People in the root of your application, and for a selected person pass an array to a Friends Component,and an array to Family Component and an array to a HobbiesComponent. Make use of ngFor.

Once data is displayed in all components, provide a button in each for Next person. Pass this event up to the root component and change the selected person the the next in the array, or the first person in the array if you are at the end.
