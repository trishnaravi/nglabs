# Chapter 4 Passing Data: Event Binding

## Objectives

- Add a button to each card that when clicked calls a function to display an alert

## Steps

1. Continue working in your angular100-labs project in your branch. If you haven't completed previous exercises, you can copy the solution files from the last exercise.

1. In **album-card.component.ts** define a function to be called:

   ```javascript
    showAlbum() {
        alert('Album selected: ' + this.album.albumName);
    }
   ```

1. In **album-card.component.html**, after (not within) the element with `<div class="card-body">`, add a footer with a button and a click event that calls the **showAlbum** function like this:

   ```html
   <div class="card-footer">
     <button class="btn btn-primary float-right" (click)="showAlbum()">
       See Details
     </button>
   </div>
   ```

1. You should now see buttons for the 3 albums in the browser and when you click - an alert should be raised with the album name.

1. Once this is working, mark your work as complete.

## Bonus

1. On a hover event of a card, console.log the name of the artist.
